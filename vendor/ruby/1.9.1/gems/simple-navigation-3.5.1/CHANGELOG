*3.5.1

* Fixed specs related to testing name_generator functionality - stub the name_generator method rather than calling it to ensure subsequent tests aren't affected.

*3.5.0

* Added (configurable) "simple-navigation-active-leaf" class to last selected element and elements that have :highlights_on return true. Thanks to Frank Schumacher (thenoseman).

*3.4.2

* Improve Gemfile dependencies with :development and :rails groups.

*3.4.1

* Rerelease using ruby-1.8.7 rather than ruby-1.9.2 in order that the rubygems.org gemspec is generated in a compatible fashion.

*3.4.0

* Added Gemfile for easier development with Bundler. Thanks to Josep Jaume.
* modified :highlights_on option to accept a :subpath option (as well as Proc and Regexp forms). This can be used to automatically highlight an item even for items within a subpath.  Thanks to Josep Jaume.

*3.3.4

* modified :highlights_on option to accept a Proc (as well as the existing Regexp form). This can be used to provide specific highlighting conditions inline. Thanks to superlou for sparking the idea for the concept.

*3.3.3

*3.3.2

* The patch listed in 3.3.1 somehow did not make it into the gem... sorry. Re-releasing...

*3.3.1

* bugfix in sinatra adapter. Use Rack::Request#scheme instead of Rack::Request#protocol. Credits to Matthew Gast.

*3.3.0

* add a new method active_navigation_item_key which returns the symbol for the currently selected navigation item in a similar way to active_navigation_item_name does for the name (useful for CSS class styling for eg.)
* open up the helper API to provide active_navigation_item and active_navigation_item_container methods to make it easy to access the items/containers should it be necessary (came for free with the above refactoring)
* isolate the apply_defaults and load_config private methods from ActionController mixin leakage by refactoring to module class instance methods
* addition of test coverage for the added helpers within helpers_spec.rb

*3.0.0

*3.0.0.beta2

* moving code for initializing plugin in sinatra to separate gem

*3.0.0.beta1

* moving deprecated rails controller methods (navigation, current_navigation) to separate file 'rails_controller_methods'. Deprecations removed. File can be required explicitly if controller methods should be still available.
* decoupling from Rails. Introducing the concept of adapters to work with several frameworks. 
* tested with Rails 3.0.0
* adding support for Sinatra and Padrino frameworks.
* cherry picking active_support stuff instead of requiring the whole bunch (tested with active_support >= 2.3.2 and 3.0.0)

* better src file organization (adapters/core/rendering folders)

*2.7.3

* initializing SimpleNavigation.config_file_path with empty array (was nil before). Allows for adding paths before gem has been initialized.

*2.7.2

*2.4.2

* Rails 3.0.0.beta2 compatibility
* Renderer::List --> make content of ul-tag html_safe for rails 3.0.0.beta2 (due to rails3 XSS protection). Credits to Johan Svensson and Disha Albaqui.
* updated copyright
* reduced visibility of 'sn_set_navigation' to protected

*2.4.1

* removing depencency to rails. It installs the newest rails, even if a matching version is present. why is that?

*2.4.0

* added Rails3 compatibility
* added Jeweler::Gemcutter Tasks to Rakefile

*2.2.3

* changed error handling in config-file. Do not ignore errors in config-file anymore.

*2.2.2

* added lib/simple-navigation.rb to allow 'require simple-navigation' or 'config.gem "simple-navigation"'

*2.2.1

* Corrected URL to API-Doc on rubyforge in README

*2.2.0

* items can now even be passed directly into render_navigation method.

*2.0.1

* fixed handling of a non-existent explicit navigation item for a navigation context

*2.0.0

* added auto_highlight feature. Active navigation is determined by comparing urls, no need to explicitly set it in the controllers anymore. Thanks to Jack Dempsey and Florian Hanke for the support on this.
* added ability to create multi-level navigations (not just limited to primary and secondary navigation). Thanks again to Jack Dempsey for the motivation ;-)
* simplified the process to explicitly set the navigation in the controller (where needed) - only deepest level has to be specified
* made auto_highlight feature configurable both on global and item_container's level
* config file is now evaluated in template if ever possible (not in controller anymore)

*1.4.2

* explicitly loading all source files when requiring 'simple_navigation'.

* doc-fix

*1.3.1

* now compliant with ruby 1.9.1 (thanks to Gernot Kogler for the feedback)

*1.3.0

* ability to turn off automatic generation of dom_ids for the list items (autogenerate_item_ids). Credits again to Richard Hulse.
* ability to specify dom_class for primary and secondary lists. Thanks Richard!

*1.2.2

* renderers now have access to request_forgery_protection stuff (this allows delete-links as navigation-items)

*1.2.1

* changed way to include render_*-helper_methods into view (including them into Controller and declaring them as helper_methods instead of adding whole module as Helper). this seems to be more reliable under certain conditions. Credits to Gernot Kogler.

*1.2.0

* added capability to add conditions to navigation-items (primary.item key, name, url, :if => Proc.new {current_user.admin?})

*1.1.2

* Bugfix: config now gets evaluated on every render_navigation call. Credits to Joël Azémar.
* Config file gets reloaded on every render_navigation call in development mode. Only load config file on server start in production mode.


*1.1.1
